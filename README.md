# Expense-tracker-miniproject
The code works in a way that gives you options to choose from, the choices are what you want to do.
note that making a list doesn't save it anywhere so once the program is closed, the lists and expenses are all gone.
otherwise you can access them.

Expense tracker mini project cuz consistency and practice makes perfect
project idea from: https://roadmap.sh/projects/expense-tracker
